# Collections Practice

# Finish the first collections assignment if you haven't already.

# Wrap each of these problems in a method, you can also write a test for each method if you'd like to practice testing.  All solutions should be generic and work for any "case" but sometimes a sample case is given.

# These problems should get progressively more difficult.

# Return true if every element of the tools array starts with an "r" and false otherwise.
#   tools = ["ruby", "rspec", "rails"]

def starts_with_r(array)
	value = true
	array.each do |word|
		if word[0] == "r"
			value = true
		else
			value = false
			break
		end
	end
	value
end

# Create a new array from the captain_planet array with all the elements that contain the letter "a".  
#   captain_planet = ["earth", "fire", "wind", "water", "heart"]

def capt_planet_new(array)
	new_array = []
	array.each do |word|
		if word.include?("a")
			new_array << word
		end
	end
	new_array
end

# Identify the first element in the stuff array that begins with the letters "wa".
#   stuff = ["candy", :pepper, "wall", :ball, "wacky"]

# Identify all the elements in the stuff array that begins with the letters "wa".
#   stuff = ["candy", :pepper, "wall", :ball, "wacky"]

# Remove anything that's not a string from an array.
# Hint: Use the method "class"  "blake".class

# Change the third letter of all strings in an array.  Your solution should work for arrays that have mixed types of objects inside it.

# Count the number of times each word appears in a string and store that data in a hash that has the word as the key and the count as the value.

#   string = "the flatiron school is better than general assembly"

# Count the number of times each hash appears in the array, remove any duplicates and add a :count key to each hash with the number of times it appears.
#   [{:name => "blake"}, {:name => "blake"}, {:name => "ashley"}]
#     becomes
#   [{:name => "blake", :count => 2}, {:name => "ashley", :count => 1}]

# Take two arrays of hashes and merge the first names and last names into a new array of hashes where each hash has all information about itself.

# [
#        {
#         :first_name => "blake"
#     },
#        {
#         :first_name => "ashley"
#     }
# ]
# and
# [
#        {
#          "blake" => {
#             :awesomeness => 10,
#                  :height => "74",
#               :last_name => "johnson"
#         },
#         "ashley" => {
#             :awesomeness => 9,
#                  :height => 60,
#               :last_name => "dubs"
#         }
#     }
# ]

# becomes
# [
#        {
#          :first_name => "blake",
#         :awesomeness => 10,
#              :height => "74",

# Return all hashes that have a value of "cool" for the :temperature key.
# [
#         {
#                :name => "ashley",
#         :temperature => "sort of cool"

# Convert the nested data structure from it's current structure
